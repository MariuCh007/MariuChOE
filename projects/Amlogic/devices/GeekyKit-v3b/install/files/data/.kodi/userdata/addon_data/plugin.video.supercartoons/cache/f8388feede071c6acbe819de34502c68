For a fee, he uses a tune on his enchanted flute to induce one of the troublesome mice to follow him out of the village, but when his mouth dries and he become desperate for breath, the Pink Panther stops playing the flute, and the mouse scurries back to the house it was plaguing. The enraged home-owner refuses to allow the panther to try again and buys a house-cat to combat the rodent. Fearing for his reputation, the Pink Panther acts to circumvent the cat and lure the mouse and its entire large family out of the house, direct to his own humble abode, where the mooching mice eat all of his food. The panther decides to become a drummer instead and attracts a parade of elephants from a zoo, which follow him against his will, and the lead mouse helps the panther by scaring the elephants away.">The Pink Panther - Pink Piper</a>
